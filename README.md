Welcome to Flask’s documentation. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

Get started with Installation and then get an overview with the Quickstart. There is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a small but complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the Patterns for Flask section. The rest of the docs describe each component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the API section.

Flask depends on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, the Jinja template engine, and the Click CLI toolkit. Be sure to check their documentation as well as Flask’s when looking for information.
